# README
In this project, we present the development and design of "Ethan's Quest: The Soulstone Chronicles," a narrative-driven survival game created using the Unity engine. The game centers on Ethan, a young protagonist on a quest to find the Soulstone, a mythical artifact believed to bridge the realms of the living and the dead. Guided by the sage Master Li, Ethan traverses mystical realms, confronting various dangers and heeding cryptic warnings. The Soulstone holds the unique power to heal emotional wounds and mend fractured bonds, providing solace to those suffering from grief and loss. Throughout his journey, Ethan encounters numerous characters struggling with their own grief, and through the power of the Soulstone, he aids them in finding hope and closure. The gameplay is designed to be deeply immersive, incorporating puzzle-solving, exploration, mindful conversation, and meaningful player choices. This paper details the game's conceptual framework, design methodology, and the therapeutic potential of its narrative elements, highlighting the innovative use of interactive storytelling to address themes of grief and emotional healing.
